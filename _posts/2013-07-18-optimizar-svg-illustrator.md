Hoy vamos a ver como optimizar un **SVG** que hemos generado a través de **Adobe Illustrator**.

Cuando exportamos código desde un programa ya sabemos de antemano que va a generar mas código de lo normal, un **SVG** por su composición no suele ocupar mucho espacio, aun así podemos hacer que ocupe todavía menos si *limpiamos* el código.

<!--more-->

El **SVG** que vamos a utilizar para este ejemplo es el buzón y sobre que ilustra mi página de contacto: <a href="http://jorgeatgu.com/img/iconosobre.svg" target="_blank">http://jorgeatgu.com/img/iconosobre.svg</a>

Este es el código que genera Illustrator con las opciones por defecto. El archivo en total pesa 19KB.

### ETIQUETA LINE

En las etiquetas `line` al no tener un color de fondo definido añade un `fill="none"` el cual no cumple ninguna función ya que el color de la línea lo vamos a definir en `stroke=""`, así que lo borramos.

También añade un `stroke-miterlimit="10"` esta propiedad se utiliza para limitar el impacto que ocasiona la unión de dos puntos en un segmento. Mucho mejor ver un ejemplo: <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/stroke.html#stroke-miterlimit" target="_blank">http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/stroke.html#stroke-miterlimit</a>
También borraremos esta propiedad ya que en este caso no nos sirve para nada.

Las coordenadas en este ejemplo podemos ver se generan con tres decimales, esta opción la podemos configurar a la hora de exportar desde el panel de Illustrator, <del datetime="2013-11-29T12:36:16+00:00">en el propio panel nos aconsejan dejarlo en tres, si bajamos de número vamos a perder precisión a la hora de posicionar los puntos.</del> <a href="http://jorgeatgu.com/blog/exportar-svg/" target="_blank">Exportar SVG con un decimal.</a>

Veamos el antes y el después de las tres primeras etiquetas `line`.

{% highlight HTML linenos %}<line fill="none" stroke="#95A5A6" stroke-width="7" stroke-miterlimit="10"
					x1="261.769" y1="395.169" x2="126.766" y2="395.169"/>

### ETIQUETAS G

En el código podemos ver que Illustrator genera etiquetas `g` para cada capa, dentro de ellas engloba el contenido de cada capa y lo identifica con un `id`, si no vamos a animar nuestro **SVG** podemos prescindir de ellas. Una recomendación es no borrarlas hasta que terminemos nuestro **SVG**, ya que con los nombres de los `id` vamos a identificar rápidamente a que pertenece cada parte de nuestro código.

### ETIQUETAS PATH Y DEFS

Las etiquetas `path` de la parte final de este **SVG** pertenecen a las letras de mi dirección de correo electrónico las cuales he convertido a trazado en Illustrator. La conversión a trazado genera mucho código así que vamos aprovechar parte de ese código para las letras que se repiten a lo largo del documento.

Abrimos una etiqueta `defs` y dentro de ella vamos a colocar la primera etiqueta `path` que pertenece a la letra c, y le añadiremos un `id="C"` para identificar la letra y poder repetir el código a través de la etiqueta `use`.

{% highlight HTML linenos %}<defs>
    <path id="C" fill="#FFFFFF" d="M339.61,377.372c-0.107,0.135-0.297,0.297-0.378,0.324c-0.648-1.351-3.079-1.756-3.538-0.648

    c0.54,0.081,1.783-1.053,1.999-1.944c0.081-0.216,1.026,0.243,0.972,0.378c-0.864,1.432-0.566,1.918-2.646,2.566
    c-2.241,0.729-3.214-1.837-3.295-2.188c-0.189-0.729-0.189-1.162-0.189-1.566c0-0.217,0-0.433,0.027-0.648
    c0.027-0.243,0.027-0.702,0-1.432c-0.081-1.944-0.297-2.161,0.675-3.97c0.729-1.486,4.564-0.945,4.916,0.351
    C339.988,377.156,339.718,377.237,339.61,377.372z"/>
</defs>{% endhighlight %}

Ahora lo que haremos será invocar este `path` a través de la etiqueta `use`.

{% highlight HTML linenos %}<use xlink:href="#C"/>
<use xlink:href="#C" transform="translate(39.5)"/>
<use xlink:href="#C" transform="translate(158)"/>{% endhighlight %}

El primer `use` corresponde a la primera letra C.
El segundo y tercer`use` corresponde a la segunda letra C, le añadimos `translate` para mover la letra horizontalmente a lo largo del documento. En los parentesis de `translate` indicamos con el primer valor el movimiento horizontal y con el segundo valor el movimiento vertical.

Ahora repetiremos esta acción con el resto de letras que se repiten.

Vamos a ver todo el código que hemos generado dentro de la etiqueta `defs` y que corresponde a las letras que se repiten.

**Con estos pasos hemos conseguido reducir nuestro SVG de 19KB a 12KB,** quizás no sea mucho pero si optimizamos todos nuestros SVG **la reducción total seguro que es una cantidad poco despreciable**.

Por último para todo aquel que prefiera ir mas rápido tiene a su disposición una web para optimizar online.

<a href="http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-editor" target="_blank">http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-editor</a>

Simplemente copiamos nuestro código **SVG** y le damos a load, ahora veremos un editor con varias opciones y lo mas importante, un visor donde podemos ver al instante los cambios y la reducción que vamos haciendo nuestro **SVG** a medida que vamos seleccionado las diferentes opciones.

Yo lo he estado probando y no esta mal pero prefiero hacerlo a mano, si probamos el visor con el **SVG** de este ejemplo y seleccionamos la optimización extrema conseguimos reducirlo a 11.3kb pero **el resultado la verdad es que deja mucho que desear ya que acopla muchos elementos y al final perdemos parte del SVG**.

**ACTUALIZACIÓN 29.11.2013**

Si queremos optimizar todavía mas nuestro SVG podemos seguir los pasos del post: <a href="http://jorgeatgu.com/blog/crear-svg-con-adobe-illustrator-y-sublime-text/" target="_blank">crear SVG con Adobe Illustrator y Sublime Text</a>, la idea es ayudarnos de Illustrator y el panel de información para conseguir sustituir los `path` por formas básicas como `rect`, `circle` y así reducir el código sin perder precisión.
